					Text based adventuer game
				<h3>
			</section>
			<p>
				This program is a simple Text based adventure game made in C# and MAUI.
				This was an assignment that we were provided a base template to work off.
				This template was there to give us an idea as to how some of the basic functionality works but otherwise, we were expected to expand the functionality and game world.
				The objective of the game was nothing more than to explore the environment and interact with objects.

				<list>
				The main goals for the program where:
					<ul>
						<li>Creating the game world</li>
						<li>Move around the game world</li>
						<li>Interacting with objects</li>
						<li>Retaining where items were in the world</li>
						<li>Picking up items and adding them to an inventory</li>
						<li>Insuering that the inventory had a limit to the amount that it could hold</li>
						<li>Dropping items from inventory back into the game world</li>
					</ul>
				</list>

			<p>
				There was an issue with the search button. 
				The intended idea of the search button was to search an object for a hidden item. 
				In most cases the functionality was fine, but issues were raised when it involved a portable object like a small box. 
				The bug came down to the fact that the item was not being removed cause the user to obtain duplicates of the hidden item. 
				The core issue seemed to be that the hidden item was not being removed from portable objects.
				With that in mind I changed how the search button to account for the fact that not only objects had items but also portable as well resolving the issue.

				Another issue that cropped up in debugging was the inventory allowing for more items than it should have. 
				In this game the inventory should allow only 5 or so items. 
				Yet under certain circumstances the inventory allows certain items to bypass the limit. 
				The fix was that the system in place to increase or decrease the current inventory size was not checking the size of the inventory with some items. 
				I mealy changed the code to account for all items and the bug was resolved.
