			<p>
				Hello my name is Riley Lengacher.  
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				I am an aspiring programmer and this website's purpose is to demonstrate what types of programs I have made.
				I have had a passion for coding since I was young.
				It started when I was in middle school when my mother thought it would be an idea for me to make my own blog with html for any writing assignments I had.
				It was very beginner level html but ever since then I have always enjoyed coding. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				I was born in Indiana but shortly after my family moved to Florida.
				I spent most of my life growing up in Florida and after 20 or so years I moved to Colorado.
				I was only there for a short amount of time before moving to where I currently live in the state of New Mexico. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				I am currently working on a degree at Central New Mexico Community College or CNM for short. 
				The degree I am working towards an AAS in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Computer Programming. 
				Because of this I have learned about many coding languages. 
			</p>
			<br/>
			<list>
				Some of the programming languages I am familiar with include:
				<ui>
					<li>C#</li>
					<li>MAUI</li>
					<li>Blazor</li>
					<li>C++</li>
					<li>Windows Forms</li>
					<li>Python</li>
					<li>Java</li>
					<li>Screenbuilder</li>
					<li>SQL</li>
				</ui>
